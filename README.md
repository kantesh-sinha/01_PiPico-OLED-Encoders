# 01_PiPico-OLED-Encoders
Raspberry Pi Pico-based project with OLED Display and Rotary Encoder for data monitoring and interaction.

Project Overview:
You will create a speed control system using a Raspberry Pi Pico, rotary encoders, and an OLED display. The system will allow you to adjust and display the current speed while providing an on/off functionality through a button.

Components Required:

    Raspberry Pi Pico (SCO915)
    Rotary Encoders (Alps Alpine EC12E24204A8) - 2 units
    OLED Display (MDOB128064XV-YI)
    Breadboard
    Jumper wires
    Soldering iron and basic electrical equipment
    Push-button (for on/off functionality)
    Power source for Raspberry Pi Pico (e.g., USB connection to a PC)
